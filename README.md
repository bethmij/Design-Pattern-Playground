# Welcome to the Design Pattern Playground! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»
This project is a Java-based playground designed to practice and demonstrate various software design patterns. It includes examples of creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns, providing a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing these key concepts in software architecture.

## Technology Stack
#### Core Technology
âœ… Java

## Key Design Patterns:

### Creational Patterns:
- Factory: Demonstrates object creation with a factory method to instantiate objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.
- Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance, providing a global point of access to the instance.
  
### Structural Patterns:
- Decorator: Allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
- Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use and manage.
  
### Behavioral Patterns:
- Observer: Implements a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
- Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
